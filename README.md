# Vanilla Plus Professions
A vanilla-friendly profession expansion mod and named VPP for short, comes with 50 professions and a whole skill tree system with 141 talents across 6 trees, which are named Talents.

## Features
A list of the main features are below:

- Skill level up limit has changed to 20 from 10 for all vanilla skills.
- 40 new professions for level 15 (8 for each vanilla skill but what you get will depend on what you chose on level 10)
- 10 special "combo" professions for level 20 which are always a crossover of two skills (2 for each vanilla skill but will *not* check what you chose at level 15)
- A clean overlay on Skills Tab to view your professions and skills over level 10 (it will recognize SpaceCore skills and their professions!)
- New craftables and machinery added for levels 11-14 and 16-19 for every vanilla skill
