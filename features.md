# Skill Changes
Following is the changes VPP adds for skills:
- Changes the skill leveling limit to be 20 instead of 10
- Adds an overlay in skills page to display your progress
- Locks Mastery Cave to be behind leveling up all skills to level 15 or 20. (Can be changed via config.json or GMCM menu)
- Adds craftables between levels 11-14 and 16-19 (Vanilla skills only, to be documented)

## New Skill Levels
VPP changes the highest skill level for vanilla skills to 20 from 10. This is not configurable due to a lot of mod features rely on this.
The vanilla and custom level experiences needed are listed below.

| Level | Experience Needed | Total Experience |

|1      | +100              | 100              |

## Skills Display
It's available ONLY if you have at least one skill above level 10 (doesn't matter whether vanilla or modded). If you can't see it still, try resizing your window. If that doesn't work too, submit a bug report. It's accessed by clicking the little plus button that appears next to the menu's border. For striped versions, it comes with a color-blindness config.

<br>
## Mastery Cave Changes
VPP changes Mastery Cave to unlock at when all skills are levelled up to 20, unless the config is turned off. It locks "Singular Mastery" and "Master of Five Ways" achievements behind that along with any and all Mastery experience to be gained.
Additionally, if you have Accessorise talent, you will be able to find trinkets even if you haven't obtained Combat Mastery yet, but you will still need the Combat Mastery to get any trinket slots.

VPP adds a total of 50 professions for all vanilla skills:
- 40 of these can be chosen at level 15 but your options will depend on what have you chosen at level 5 and 10.

<br/>Machines that take coop animal goods have a chance to double their output. (Machinery as in Mayonnaise machine or loom, but VPP doesn't try to keep track of wool comes from whether a sheep or a rabbit as that'd require effort that isn't worth it imho.)

For Mod Authors: If your animal(s) live in the coop and their products use machines that aren't Mayonnaise Machine or Loom, you should add ``StackModifiers`` to your rules to double the amount of the output. You can use the ``HasProfession`` token to 
detect if the player has this profession.
### Breeder (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c67e270-47b1-40cf-99f3-b8cf56beca08" />
<br/>Coop animals are worth more when sold.

For Mod Authors: You don't need to do anything, as VPP will automatically detect your animal if it lives in any vanilla coop.
### Musterer (Lv15)

<br/>Machines that take barn animal goods work faster.
Loom, Mayonnaise machine (only for ostrich eggs) and cheese presses will work faster.

For Mod Authors: If your animal(s) live in the barn and their products use machines that aren't Loom or Cheese Press, or if 
they use Mayonnaise Machine you should add ``ReadyTimeModifiers`` to the said machinery to make the your produce faster. You can use the ``HasProfession`` token to detect if the player has this profession.
### Caretaker (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aa7e07d-0f23-405c-9f1e-461e458eac91" />
<br/>Milk pail and shears take no energy. Chance for hay eaten by animals to not be consumed. The chance for animals to not eat hay is %35, and its evaluated for every animal individually.

For Mod Authors: For custom animals, you don't need to do anything as VPP will apply these effects automatically for any animal. If you add any custom tools for animals, you'll have to check if the player has a profession with the ID of ``33``.
### Machinist (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee959da7-3722-410a-bad2-1a6fb2a711a2" />
<br/>Machines that take harvested crops work faster.
Preserves Jar, Keg and Oil Maker will process 25% faster when the inputs are harvested crops.

For Mod Authors: If you add machinery that accept crops, you should add a ReadyTimeModifier that applies the same effect when
### Connoisseur (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95899958-bf7e-4f7d-9b4e-254fcd1eac11" />
<br/>Artisan goods are loved by NPCs.
Most NPCs will love most artisan goods, but it wont automatically make every artisan good loved. Exclusion cases are mentioned below.

For Mod Authors: VPP chooses to ignore the characters or items in the following cases:
1) The item is alcoholic (has the ``alcohol_item`` context tag)
2) The NPC has it as a hated or disliked gift
3) The NPC has an entry of ``"Kedi.VPP.ExcludeFromConnoisseur": "true"`` in their Data/Characters entry's CustomFields
So if you want to exclude an item for your NPC fully or just have it ignore your NPC/item, add any of those
### Horticulturist (Lv15)

<br/>Trees grown in greenhouses will give iridium-quality produce.

For Mod Authors: There's nothing you should do to add compatibility with this profession.
### Agronomist (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2257d0bc-ac2b-4ee9-b8aa-300a3615081d" />
<br/>If a crop is grown outside of a greenhouse, chance for fertilizer to not be consumed.
Once you choose this profession, for every fertilizer you use outside of a greenhouse, each time its got a %30 chance to not be consumed. Gem dusts made with geode crushers are also affected by this profession.

For Mod Authors: Crop modders do not have to do anything, but for mods that add custom fertilizers, you might need to check if the player has a profession with the ID of ``37``.
### Farming-Mining (Lv20)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/867c2548-9bb8-4e13-8b81-bf0a2f9381e5" />
<br/>This profession allows you to use the Geode Crusher to produce Gem Dusts out of minerals, which you can use in place of fertilizers (gem dusts are affected by Agronomist profession as well.)
Which type of effect they give depends on their price and color:

| Color                        | Effect             |
|:----------------------------:|:------------------:|
| Green, black<br/>dark brown  | Tree Fertilizer    |
| Red<br/>Purple & Pink        | Speed-Gro          |
| Orange<br/>Yellow & Brown    | Quality Fertilizer |
| Blue, Cyan<br/>White, Gray   | Retaining Soil     |

| Price Range      | Strength Of Effect |
|:----------------:|:------------------:|
| < 120g           | Low[^3]            |
| >= 120g & <=280g | Medium[^3]         |
| > 280g           | High[^3]           |

[^3]: Doesn't affect Tree Fertilizer Gem Dusts

For Mod Authors: If you add custom minerals, they should have an appropriate color tag and be in the minerals category. If both of those are met, VPP will make gem dusts of your custom mineral too.
### Farming-Foraging (Lv20)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon41" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe3f8656-1ab2-4570-a6f4-fab1f49fca8d" />
<br/>Fruit trees and giant crops are tappable.
You can now tap any giant crop and fruit tree with any tapper. Every 5 days that the tapper isn't removed, it will yield either a custom item defined by the game data (goes only for custom giant crops and fruit tree) or a Fruit Syrup flavored with the crop or fruit of the giant crop/fruit tree. 

- For Mod Authors: If you want your fruit tree or giant crop to give a custom item instead of a Fruit Syrup, you should add an entry like ``"Kedi.VPP.DoesUseCustomItem": "Example.ModID_UnqualifiedItemID"`` to the fruit tree/giant crop data's CustomFields. Otherwise you don't have to do anything other than giving your fruit tree or giant crop at least one fruit/crop.

<br/>Attaching bait to a fishing rod will prevent trash from being caught.
If the first catch is a trash item, the catch determination process is re-run up to 100 times, then the mod lets it go to prevent infinite loops even if its a trash.

<br/>Treasure chests contain rarer and more valuable items.
Some drops will be switched with others upon fishing these treasures with a rod. The artifact drops will be replaced only if you have donated them to the museum already. Full drops are explained below:

<br/>Adding bait to a crab pot guarantees a high-quality catch.

<br/>Chance for recycled trash to produce various tackles.
There's a chance that putting trash in recycling machine will output tackles. Full drops are explained below:

| Type of Trash   | Possible Drop                               |
|:---------------:|:-------------------------------------------:|
| Trash           | Lead Bobber (%25)<br/>Sonar Bobber (%10)    |
| Soggy Newspaper | Trap Bobber (%25)<br/>Treasure Hunter (%10) |
| Broken Glasses  | Trap Bobber (%25)<br/>Treasure Hunter (%10) |
| Broken CD       | Spinner (%25)<br/>Dressed Spinner (%10)     |
| Driftwood       | Cork Bobber (%25)<br/>Quality Bobber (%10)  |

For Mod Authors: If you aren't adding custom tackles, this shouldn't matter for your mod. If so, you should add machine rules to Recycling Machine to give your tackle as output. VPP adds rules for vanilla tackles, with a chance of %25 for common ones and %10 for rarer ones. You can use the ``HasProfession`` token to detect if the player has this profession.

<br/>Full fish ponds will continue making item requests. If completed, double yield for the rest of the week.
Fish ponds that are full will ask for quest items, just as they did while wanting to expand the population. If you bring the item to them, they'll give double items for the rest of the week.

For Mod Authors: Your fish must have at least one ``PopulationGate`` entry to be compatible with this profession.

Every vanilla gem will act like a certain vanilla tackle when placed to the fishing rod. The matches are:

| Gem           | Tackle it Acts Like |
|:-------------:|:-------------------:|
| Prismatic Shard| Curiosity Lure      |
| Diamond        | Quality Bobber      |
| Ruby           | Treasure Hunter     |
| Emerald        | Barbed Hook         |
| Jade           | Trap Bobber         |
| Aquamarine     | Lead Bobber         |
| Amethyst       | Dressed Spinner     |
| Topaz          | Cork Cobber         |

NOTE: After being used at least once, they WILL NOT stack with other gems, even if they're of the same type!

For Mod Authors: There's nothing you should do to add compatibility with this profession.

### Arborist (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43a40092-e74f-4211-bef8-c977e2c65aff" />
<br/>Wild trees grow faster.

For Mod Authors: There's nothing you should do to add compatibility with this profession.
### Shaker (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbff3cfc-307f-4172-aeac-4846cda5d85e" />
<br/>Chance for wild trees to drop items when shaken.
When shaked, any tree with leaves may drop:

| Item Name     | Chance | Season |
|:-------------:|:------:|:------:|
| Hazelnut      | %10    | Any    |
| Duck Feather  | %10    | Any    |
| Hay           | %10    | Any    |
| Fiber         | %10    | Any    |
| Hardwood      | %10    | Any    |
| Stone         | %10    | Any    |
| Wood          | %10    | Any    |
| Spice Berry   | %10    | Summer |
| Wild Plum     | %10    | Fall   |
| Tea Set       | %1     | Spring |
| Crystal Fruit | %10    | Winter |
| Gold Ore      | %10    | Any    |
| Iron Ore      | %10    | Any    |
| Copper Ore    | %10    | Any    |

The chances are not a cumulative thing to %100, it's the chance that the item will be used 
So the process is roughly
-> Game chooses an entry -> if Season matches -> %-Chance- it will be dropped.

For Mod Authors: You can add items as drops for your custom wild trees' ``ShakeItems`` and ``SeedDropItems`` fields. You can use the ``HasProfession`` token to see if the player has the profession.
### Sapper (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d009d767-565d-4d3a-a741-7f06bcebef80" />
<br/>Tappers work faster.
All tappers will output %20 faster.

For Mod Authors: If you add custom tappers, add ``tapper_multiplier_<speed>`` context tag to your item. Vanilla takes the speed bit and sets the minutes-until-ready to ``daysUntilReady x 1 / speed`` . You can use the ``HasProfession`` token to see if the player has the profession.
### Orchardist (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf73dd47-026d-4558-89f4-87fceeefc47d" />
<br/>Tappers give double harvest.

For Mod Authors: There's nothing you need to do to add compatibility with this profession.
### Ranger (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ffb929b-12e9-4468-b82b-9a2825459d79" />
<br/>Forest forage worth more. The prices will be doubled.

For Mod Authors: You can exclude your custom forage if you give it the ``kedi_vpp_banned_ranger`` context tag.
### Adventurer (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea9a0f6d-f9af-4d64-a6c2-47ed2a634907" />
<br/>Non-forest forage worth more. The prices will be doubled.

For Mod Authors: You can exclude your custom forage if you give it the ``kedi_vpp_banned_adventurer`` context tag.
### Gleaner (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b31643f-fece-4fe0-8704-3b6fea42e70f" />
<br/>Crop seeds can be found as forage.

Any vanilla seed may be found during their growing seasons in Forest, Mountain and Backwoods. (VPP will only affect vanilla seeds, but other mods can add theirs too.)

For Mod Authors: If you add custom crops, you can add your seeds as forage with a chance of 0.1, if you wish.

### Wayfarer (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bdef1be-a341-4735-b997-dca2a880e2e1" />
<br/>Chance for forage to be found out of season.

Any vanilla forage may be found OUT OF their regular seasons as well, for example a Holly may appear in Summer, Fall and Spring as well with this profession.
VPP affects only vanilla forage on its own, but other mods may add theirs too.

For Mod Authors: If you add custom forage, you can add your forage with a chance of 0.1 out of their regular seasons, if you wish.

### Foraging-Fishing (Lv20)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e3ab6b2-1875-48ba-ba74-ed411dd72a3c" />
<br/>Every four days, a randomly-selected forage item will be able to summon fishing bubbles when tossed in the water.

For Mod Authors: If you want your forage to be included by this, make sure it has the ``forage_item`` context tag.
If you want your forage to be excluded, make sure it has ``vpp_forageThrowGame_banned`` context tag.

### Foraging-Combat (Lv20)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon45" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ac591ab-871d-4046-aa61-35998f5f32d6" />
<br/>Off-screen monsters can be tracked.
Similar to the Tracker Profession in vanilla, when you choose this profession you'll be shown small and moving red arrows that points at monsters.

For Mod Authors: There's nothing you should do to add compatibility with this profession.

<br/>Metal bars require less materials to produce.
For all vanilla bars and for Furnace and Heavy Furnaces, the amount of ores are reduced by %20

For Mod Authors: If you add custom metal bars, then you should also reduce the material amount by %20.
### Ironmonger (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon26" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35d0ceb5-cd3f-4e73-8fe9-0f7b206a26dc" />
<br/>Ores are worth more.

For Mod Authors: If you add custom ores, then you should also double your ore's sell price.
### Ignitor (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37820499-03d7-4ddf-9d0d-b8ce038d68fd" />
<br/>Furnaces work faster.
Makes it so that any metal bar is processed %20 faster in both Furnace and Heavy Furnaces.

For Mod Authors: If you add custom ores and metal bars, you should also make furnaces faster.
### Crafter (Lv15)
<img width="78" height="78" alt="Icon28" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/056d36d7-e16a-4026-9587-41e6a469ad21" />

The recipe changes are explained below:

| Transmute (Fe) | 3 copper bars | 5 copper bars[^4] |
| Transmute (Au) | 2 iron bars | 3 iron bars[^4] |

[^4]: The output is doubled.


For Mod Authors: If you add custom crafting recipes to unlock with Mining skill, you should lower the materials required.

# Talents
## What even is this?
VPP adds a skill point system named 'talents' which is built from ground to the top. Every talent is a perk purchasable with 'talent points', and each of them change a different aspect of the game.
Its said to be alike Skyrim's skill trees, but to be quite honest I haven't played it so I can't confirm nor deny.

## How do I get talent points?

|         Way to obtain          |  Talent points obtainable |
|:------------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Levelling up in any skill      | 1 (each level up)         |
| Completing Achievements        | 1 (each achievement)      |
| Succeeding in Qi's Challenges  | 1 (only once per SO)      |
| Achieving Perfection           | 10                        |

Once obtained, all talent points are shared across all skill trees so for example if you gained one point from levelling up Farming, you can use it in the Foraging or Combat trees etc. with no restrictions.

## Can I reset my talents?
You are allowed to reset the trees as often as you want, but you have to use one of:
- Stardrop Tea: To reset the tree you're currently viewing
- Prismatic Shard: To reset all trees at once

VPP wont allow you to reset if you haven't used any points yet (at all or since the last reset),
and after requesting the reset you have to confirm or abort so you can't accidentally waste items or initiate using both items.

## What do each talent do exactly? I'd like to spoil myself.
It adds a grand total of 141 talents divided across 6 skill trees, 25 for each vanilla skill and 16 extras for one tree that isn't spesific to any skills.

<br>
This talent will changes the recipes of Iridium sprinkler and Quality Sprinkler, the old and new recipes are listed below:
<br>
|     Sprinkler     |                    Old Recipe                   |                       New Recipe                      |

For Mod Authors: If you want your custom mines to be affected by this talent, add the ``Kedi.VPP.Upheaval`` key to your Data/Locations entry's CustomFields... field. Optionally, you can add a space-delimited list of UNQUALIFIED object IDs for the geode nodes you want your regular stones to be replaced with as value. If you don't set it, VPP will just use the vanilla ones instead. As a bonus, if you have custom nodes as well, add them the ``Kedi_VPP_Bland_Stone_Node`` context tag to your "stone items".

### Matryoshka
Chance for geodes to contain another geode.

For Mod Authors: If you add custom geodes and want your geodes to not be dropped by this talent, add the ``kedi_vpp_banned_from_being_dropped`` context tag to them, if you don't want your geode to not drop other geodes, add the ``kedi_vpp_banned_from_dropping`` context tag.

### X-ray
View what item the next geode contains.

For Mod Authors: If you add custom geodes and want your geodes' content to not be seen by this talent, add them the ``geode_crusher_ignored`` tag. But know that adding the tag will also prevent your geodes to be crushed by the Geode Crusher.

### Geometry
Crystalariums work faster.

The chance is ``0.0001 * mineLevel`` per stone.

### Everyone's Best Friend
Diamond, tigerseye, opal, fire opal, jasper, and star shards will become universal loved gifts.

Note: This talent only makes these gems into universal loves. Due to how gift taste logic works, if a character's own gift data lists any of these as loved/hated/disliked/neutral/liked, their own gift data will take priority over universals (Such as Haley hating prismatic shards despite prismatic shards being universal loves). **This is not a bug with VPP. It's a vanilla feature.**

### Crystal Cavern
Low chance for all stones on a mine floor\nto be replaced by gem nodes. The chance for it to trigger is 0.0005.
For vanilla mines; Ruby, Jade, Diamond, Aquamarine, Topaz and Emerald Nodes may appear with equal random chances.

Note: As of 1.1.0, you can modify the chance to trigger from VPP's balance configs.

For Mod Authors: If you want your custom mines to be affected by this talent, add the ``Kedi.VPP.CrystalCavern`` key to your Data/Locations entry's CustomFields... field. Optionally, you can add a space-delimited list of UNQUALIFIED object IDs for the gem nodes you want your regular stones to be replaced with as value. If you don't set it, VPP will just use the vanilla ones instead.

### Over The Rainbow
Add prismatic shard crafting recipe.
The recipe will require one of every gem.
<br>

<br>

![ForagingTalents](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c77b4061-72e1-4f15-9abb-f9f20c115dfa)

### Nature Secrets
Chance for chopped tree stumps to drop forage items.

Note: If you're using CJB Cheat Menu's One-Hit-Break on trees, the talent may not work if you cut both the stump and the tree body too quickly. This is due to how the tree falling logic works.

### Berry-mania
Berry seasons last for one week.

### Desert Bloom
Chance for flowers to spawn in Calico Desert on rainy days in Pelican Town.

### Bountiful Boletes
High chance for mushrooms to spawn after rainy days.

For Mod Authors: If you add custom mushrooms and want them to be affected by this talent, you need to add one of these context tags to them; ``edible_mushroom`` or ``kedi_vpp_poisonous_mushroom``, but the edible mushroom tag will make them available for Dehydrators' Dried Mushrooms as well which might not be intended.

### Renewing Mist
Double forage spawns on the first sunny day after rain.

### Reforestation
Hand-planted wild tree seeds produce double harvest.

### Sap Sipper
Sap is edible and recovers health.

<br>
<img width="331" height="337" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5db01c40-1b6e-4f92-88ef-7beb24e09d69" />

<img width="372" height="356" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe0aef80-ce56-4ed2-821a-0758dab1b28d" />
<br>
It also slightly modifies the Cookout Kit recipe to be easier to craft.
### Survival Cooking
Adds unique recipes to Cookout Kits.
There will be new 10 cooking recipes that will be only available from Cookout Kits. So you wont be able to cook them in regular kitchens. Most of VPP-spesific ones use forage as ingredients because they're supposed to heal the player a middle amount while they're out in the wild.

The new recipes and their ingredients are listed below:
|        Food         |             Recipe             |
|:-------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| Grilled Leek        | 1 Leek                         |
| Seaweed Salad       | 2 Seaweed                      |
| Trail Mix           | 1 Hazelnut<br/>1 Spice Berry   |
| Roasted Fiddleheads | 1 Fiddlehead Fern              |
| Wild Fruit Salad    | 1 Blackberry<br/>1 Salmonberry |
| Grilled Fish        | 1 Any Fish                     |
| Baked Tubers        | 1 Snow Yam<br/>1 Winter Root   |
| Mushroom Kebab      | 2 Common Mushroom              |
| Fried Bug Steak     | 1 Bug Steak                    |
| Steamed Clams       | 2 Clam                         |

Note: Cooking with this talent activated will result in Qi Seasoning not being consumed and the cooked foods will be gold quality automatically. This is intended because when two independent items stacks are combined into one, the other loses all of its custom price, edibility and modData entries (which is something mods often use to add extra data to anything in the game), and so much other data. The gold quality intends to prevent the stacking so prevent the data loss.

For Mod Authors: If you have such recipes and want them to be added in this, add them the ``kedi_vpp_survival_cooking_food`` context tag.

### Pyrolysis
Charcoal Kilns will be more efficient. New drops since 1.0.4:
| Input       | Output   |

| Mutant Carp</br>Radioactive Carp   | 5-10 Radioactive Ore (%15), 25-30 Seaweed/Green Algae (%30) |

For mod authors: Give non-roe drops for your legendary fish locked behind this talent normally. But you should use "BigFishSmallPond" while addressing this talent with GSQs and CP tokens, because this talent's name had to change due to 1.6.9

| Broken Glasses  | Aerinite (%10)<br/>Ghost Crystal (%10) |

### Smokehouse
Fish can be smoked multiple times to increase quality.

So if you have a fish with lowest quality, 
Then you can smoke it once to turn it into a smoked fish with lowest quality,
If you smoke it again, you will get a silver quality one. If you smoke it again, it'll be gold quality and so on.

### Fit for a Czar
Aged Roe can be aged in a cask to increase quality.
This also affects Caviar as well.

<br>

Chance for crab pots to produce artifact troves.
If your crab pots are empty, there's a %10 chance your crab pot will have an artifact trove.

### Diversification
Wild Bait now doubles Crab Pot produce.
(This doesn't apply to Dead Man's Chest, obviously)

### Fish Trap
Crab pots will sometimes catch regular fish.
If your crab pots are empty or they have trash, there's a %25 chance your crab pot will have a non-crab-pot fish.

### Bait and Switch
Chance for crab pot fish to increase in quality if left uncollected overnight.

### Crab Rave
Increased chance to find crabs, crayfish and lobsters if wearing a Crabshell Ring.

### Fish's Wishes
Allows using Magic Bait on crab pots. If you have Luremaster, basic Bait acts like Magic Bait.

### Here Fishy Fishy
Failing to catch any fish 3 times in a row greatly increases the bobber bar height for the next fish.
If you fail more than 3 times, the bobber bar height will also keep increasing in size until you catch at least one fish.

### Vast Domain
Legendary fish can be caught in an increased location range.

### One Fish, Two Fish
Challenge Bait can be used to catch four fish at once.

### Take a Break
Fish do not run away when reeling in a treasure chest.
The "progress bar" just stops until you're complete collecting the chest or stop reeling it.

### Bubble Trouble
Bubbles will always be within 4 tiles of land.
In other words, bubbles wont be further than 4 tiles away from the land.

## Combat Talents
![Combat Talents](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb961c55-72cc-48a2-91cb-53a540b53f71)

### Slimeshot
Slime can be used as slingshot ammo. If slime hits a monster, it will be slowed down.
But the effect will be applied only once.

### Triple Shot
Gives slingshots a special attack that shoots three projectiles at once.

Note: The talent automatically disables itself if the slingshot has the auto-fire enchantment from the Enchanting talent, for the sake of balance.
Note #2: It's intended that you can "slide" around while casting the triple shot. It's supposed to make using slingshots slightly easier and be a lil funny bit.

### Bullseye
Slingshots can do critical damage.
In vanilla, slingshots are blocked from dealing critical damage (for unknown reasons. It just is but it makes no sense.)

### Dazzling Strike
Gems can be used as slingshot ammo.<br/>nHigh chance for gem ammo<br/>nto not be destroyed.

### Enchanting
Slingshots have custom enchantments called Auto-Fire, Rapid, Bat Killer, and Thrifty.
The effects are listed below:

| Name       | Effect |
|:----------:|:------:|
| Auto-Fire  | Slingshot will automatically<br/>fire while you aim |
| Rapid      | Slingshot ammo will<br/>move faster |
| Bat Killer | Double damage<br/>done to bats |
| Thrifty    | Slingshot might not use<br/>ammo at times |

### Accessorise
Trinkets can be converted into rings.
A new big craftable recipe is added into your crafting recipes, which is named "Trinket Workbench" and is craftable for 50 hardwood & 3 iron bars.

<br>
Note: Said rings spawned from CJB or SMAPI console will not be functional because both of those wont do some necessary changes VPP does. Trinket rings can't be combined with any ring since version 1.0.3.

For Mod Authors: If you add custom trinkets, you need to add a custom ring item, and add an entry like ``"Kedi.VPP.AccessoriseRing": "ExampleAuthor.ExampleMod_UnqualifiedItemIDForMyRing"`` to your trinket's CustomFields field. This is needed for VPP to match your trinket to your ring.

### Consolidation
Rings of the same type can be forged together.
There is only one exception to this. Combined Rings still can't be combined again.

### Hidden Benefits
All vanilla trinkets will get a second purpose.

There are 8 trinkets in vanilla, and one extra purpose for each.
In case there are people who want to learn what it is themselves, the hint locations are listed below:

| Trinket name   | Location          |
|:--------------:|:-----------------:|
| Golden Spur    | Marnie's Shop     |
| Frog Egg       | Sebastian's Room  |
| Parrot Egg     | Emily's Room      |
| Fairy Box      | Jas' Room         |
| Ice Rod        | Pierre's Shop     |
| Basilisk Paw   | Wizard's Basement |
| Magic Quiver   | Adventurer Guild  |

<details>
  <summary>If you don't want to try figure them out...</summary>

| Trinket name   | Second Purpose          |
|:--------------:|:-----------------------:|
| Golden Spur    | Tailored into Cowboy Boots using Leather Boots, which plays a special song while worn. |

If you have slime charmer ring, the talent wont be effectful against slimes.

### Slippery
Changes the Slimy debuff into a +1 Speed buff.

### Fortified
For every monster in the current location, gain +1 Defense to a limit of +8.
(aka capped at 8, so if there is 15 monsters there, the buff will still be +8.)

### Full Knowledge
Gives full exp for monsters killed on the farm.

In vanilla, slain farm monsters give you only 1/3 of the original XP (since 1.6). This talent restores it to full.

For Mod Authors: If you add custom monsters via C# (excluding FTM monsters), and if they're not a subclass of any vanilla monsters, contact me for compatibility.

### Sugar Rush
Foods cooked with sugar will remove the Nauseated debuff. If you have Survival Cooking, its recipes will remove Nauseated as well.

For Mod Authors: As of 1.1.0, VPP will automatically detect any recipe with sugar in it, custom or vanilla.

### Meditation
Passive health regeneration while standing still.
Every 10 in-game minutes, you will gain 15 points of health.

## Daily Life Talents

### Monumental Discount

For Mod Authors: If you're a custom NPC author and want your NPC(s) affected by this talent, you need to add an entry to your NPC's CustomFields. The format DOES NOT accept context tags or category IDs. The value should be a space-delimited list of UNQUALIFIED item IDs. Example code block:

```json
"ExampleAuthor.MyCustomCharacter": {
  //blablabla other important stuff go here
  "CustomFields": {
    "KediDili.VanillaPlusProfessions_InsiderInfoData": "123 456 789 102 425" //Value is item ids of your choice.
  }
}
```

### Gift of Friendship
The villagers will start giving you gifts after you're close enough to them to show their gratitude. The gifts are usually the villagers' loved and liked gifts.

For Mod Authors: If you're a custom NPC author and want your NPC(s) affected by this talent, you should add a CT response for ``VPP.GiftOfFriendship`` in their dialogue file, with a when condition if they have 8 hearts or above with the farmer. You can to make it less or more than 8 hearts depending on how your character is like, its just what I set vanilla NPCs to react to.
### Haute Cuisine
Increases sell prices of cooked food.
Doubles the sell price of cooking category objects, there's nothing you need to do add compatibility with this talent.

Note: Cooking with this talent activated will result in Qi Seasoning not being consumed and the cooked foods will be silver quality automatically. This is intended because when two independent items stacks are combined into one, the other loses all of its custom price, edibility and modData entries (which is something mods often use to add extra data to anything in the game), and so much other data. The silver quality intends to prevent the stacking so prevent the data loss.

### Mini Fridge, Big Space
Increase storage space for mini-fridges.
Makes it so that mini-fridges will act like big chests.

For Mod Authors: There's nothing you need to do add compatibility with this talent.
### Good Eats
Allows for two food buffs and two drink buffs simultaneously.

For Mod Authors: There's nothing you need to do add compatibility with this talent.
### Lost And Found
Reading lost books after they've been found gives you daily buffs, reading another book while one will override the previous book buff and the buffs will be removed next day. Here are the buffs for vanilla lost books:
